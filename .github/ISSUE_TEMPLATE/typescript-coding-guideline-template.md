<!--**Style vocabulary**
Each guideline describes either a good or bad practice, and all have a consistent presentation.

The wording of each guideline indicates how strong the recommendation is.

**Do** is one that should always be followed. Always might be a bit too strong of a word. Guidelines that literally should always be followed are extremely rare. On the other hand, you need a really unusual case for breaking a Do guideline.

**Consider** guidelines should generally be followed. If you fully understand the meaning behind the guideline and have a good reason to deviate, then do so. Please strive to be consistent.

**Avoid** indicates something you should almost never do. Code examples to avoid have an unmistakable red header.

**Why?** gives reasons for following the previous recommendations.-->



## Do <Your description>

## Consider <Your description>
